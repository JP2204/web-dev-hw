      <h4>song lyrics</h4>
      <p> Bandit
          Juice Wrld, YoungBoy Never Broke Again

          It's funny, the shit I put on this song
          Ain't gon' sound nothin' like the shit we was just doin'
          Oh, yeah
          I just want bad bitches
          Baddest, them bitches is the baddest, uh, uh
          When I take the molly, I'm a savage
          Uh, I say, uh
          I don't need no molly to be savage, uh
          When I'm on that molly, I feel savage, uh uh
          She the definition of a bad bitch
          Stole her, I'm the definition of a bandit, uh ayy
          I don't need no molly to be savage, uh ayy
          But when I'm on the molly, I feel savage
          Ayy, my girl the definition of a bad bitch
          Stole her heart, I'm the definition of a bandit
          Put the Percs down and picked up the jiggas, jiggas, jiggas
          Tommy in the fucking Tommy Hilfiger, 'figer, 'figer
          That Tommy hit a nigga, Tommy Hilfiger, fuck niggas
          I'm nice, when I'm high off the pills, I'ma fuck with her
          I don't smoke skunk, but tonight I'm getting stuck, nigga
          Pour the codeine up and put some molly in the cup with it
          I know she a freak, uh-huh, she gon' fuck with it
          She my Velcro, uh-huh, guess I'm stuck with her
          I dive in it like a sailor, I love to nail her
          Addicted to her paraphernalia, I had to tell her
          I see it like a fortune teller
          Your ex-nigga did good, I could do better
          Bad bitch from the woods, I think she a hunter
          She a killer and an eater, she a Jeffery Dahmer
          I can tell when she in her feelings, I can read her like a book
          No TEC, no Beretta, FN on me, am I understood?
          Yeah, yeah, yeah
          I don't need no molly to be savage, uh
          When I'm on that molly, I feel savage, uh uh
          She the definition of a bad bitch
          Stole her, I'm the definition of a bandit, uh ayy
          I don't need no molly to be savage, uh ayy
          But when I'm on the molly, I feel savage
          Ayy, my girl the definition of a bad bitch
          Stole her heart, I'm the definition of a bandit
          My brother point her out and she a bad bitch, I'm on her
          Must ain't heard that I'm a savage, once I get a bitch, I own her
          I see she got swag, I got cash so I want her
          See this .45 in my pants, put on your ass, push up on bruh
          Shawty, she a rider with that Glizzy on her (with that Glizzy on her)
          And shawty, I'ma die there with no semi on me (semi on me)
          If we got a problem, we get rid of homie (yeah)
          Put twenty thousand in your pocket, we gon' get the money (yeah)
          I'm the definition of a bandit (come on, bruh)
          Took your heart from out his hands and still ain't saying shit (honest)
          Some new killers in my circle you done ran with it
          Like this dirty .38, this bitch'll damage
          Popping wheelies, 4K Trey, pop when you land with it (pop, pop, pop)
          I let you drive inside my bros where they been laying with it
          I work this bitch, I open up a can with it
          Like fuck the stove, I make it jump without my hand in it
          I don't need no molly to be savage, uh
          When I'm on that molly, I feel savage, uh uh
          She the definition of a bad bitch
          Stole her, I'm the definition of a bandit, uh ayy
          I don't need no molly to be savage, uh ayy
          But when I'm on the molly, I feel savage
          Ayy, my girl the definition of a bad bitch
          Stole her heart, I'm the definition of a bandit </p>
