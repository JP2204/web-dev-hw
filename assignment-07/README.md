Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

my work cycle started with figuring out a song to use, i chose bandit by juice wrld and its an explicit song but it is one of my favorites right now. after i had the song chosen i went about setting up my index with the 4 main document elements and the 4 meta elements. everything went pretty smooth until i got to the multi source video elements where i ran into the problem of my files not working. i figured out i moved the wrong ones to a new file which caused the video to not appear on my website. i was able to fix it once i found this was the issue. i also had trouble getting the logo poster to appear on the video and i was not able to fix this issue.
