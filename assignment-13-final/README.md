Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

from the beginning of the semester it was a new learning experience for me, but as the semester went on the concepts and nuances of coding became easier and easier.




Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?

I had a little experience with web design from other classes but this class went way more in depth with layout design and typography and everything that makes a site look good.

I took code from other assignments to make my life easier and then tweaked the code to make the site design different than other assignments.
