Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?
I have come across forms that require me to enter my username and password in order to login to a site or service. these forms serve as a way for the site to recognize who I am by collecting my username and password.


List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.

text would be used to create a text box for users to put in information like a birthyear or name.

selection would be used when you are asking the user a question and you supply predetermined answers or choices. for example if you are trying to determine what year a student is you would ask what year are you? and you would provide freshman, sophomore etc as predetermined choices.

button input would be used to submit something like on a search engine or if you need to upload a file you would push a button.
