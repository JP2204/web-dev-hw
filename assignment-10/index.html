    <h1>A speech about my cat.</h1>

    <div class="text">
      <p>Every time I look at you I think back to the first time that we meet and how I was not quite sure what to think of you. I’ve had some bad experiences with others like you in my life, which have steered me away from you. We were as different as night and day, But I decided to give you a chance because I thought hey what could go wrong they cannot be that bad, plus opposites attract right? and Let me say boy was I glad I gave you a shot. I would have never guessed that we would become so close in such a short amount of time and it began as soon as I saw you. but having you in my life has been truly amazing and I am extremely grateful for everything you do no matter how big or small. You make my good days even better, you make my bad days not so bad, I could be having the worst day ever but as soon as I see you its as if all my worries and stresses of the day disappear. You help me with my problems without me really having to ask, when I am feeling stressed or battling with my anxiety you seem to know, I don’t know how, but you do, and you help calm me down by doing this little purr that I have no idea how you do and by just showing that you care whether that be by sitting next to me or just rubbing up against me. Your curiosity is another thing I love about you, but I have to say I don’t like when your curiosity leads you to climbing in the ceilings and then getting stuck in the ceiling because you cannot get down and yelling at me to help get you down, or bugging me to take you outside or take you for a ride in the car even though you get scared every time I do or when you do this little tail flicker whenever you see a bird or a squirrel. I don’t know your back story completely, but when I picked you up from the shelter they told me you were abandoned by your previous owner which explains why you cannot stand when I have to leave the house even if it’s only for ten minutes. Relationships are hard to build they require trust, comfort, communication, and connection and I feel we have all those although when I talk to you, you have no idea what I’m saying like I’m speaking a foreign language, but when you communicate with me and I feel like I know exactly what you’re saying as I bet every pet owner feels the same. But with all that being said your more than just a cat or pet to me, your family, your my best friend, your my get away from adult life, my escape from reality. I have always been a dog person ever since I was young and, I never thought that I would or could be a cat person, but you completely changed my idea of how cats truly are. You’re not evil like everyone says, and you’re not out to kill me. Of all the many things I love about you Oliver, these are just a few things that stand out to me and I hope you never change because to me your perfect the way you are and I thank you for turning me into a cat person you guys aren’t so bad, and I look forward to the future and making new memories together over the years to come.
