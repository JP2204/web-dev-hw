What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?

a system font is a font that is pre-installed on a computer or other device, web fonts are fonts hosted on a server not your device, and web-safe fonts are available to both operating systems making them ideal for use on the web.



What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?

having fallback fonts is important because if you have a font in mind but the user trying to see your work does not have that font you will need backup fonts that will load for the user to see your work.
