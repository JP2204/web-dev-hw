Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?
my client is a fishing guide back home in northern New York who specializes in fly fishing, they just wanted something simple and clean, that was easy to navigate and got the information across as clear as possible.


What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?
block aligns elements in a vertical manner while inline-block aligns horizontally and inline aligns like text.


Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
first i started with my client i love to fish so i went with a guide, i used colors that resembled water and used a picture of fishing gear to tell you quickly that this site deals with fishing. then i went through the seteps of the previous assignment and everything went a lot smoother this time.
