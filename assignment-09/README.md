Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

The universal selector is used to style every element on a page, the id selector allows for style on a specific element by its id tag, The element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type, and the class selector uses the class tag to style. you would choose to use the id, element, and class selectors when you want to be more precise and the universal when you want to choose everything.




Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.

I chose a teal for the background (rgb(5, 227, 246)) because its very bright and alot of colors were bright in the 90's I chose pink (rgb(255, 97, 246)) for the heading to add more brightness and orange (rgb(255, 148, 0))for the text at the top for more contrast.

i started with looking for pics that summarize the 90's and then i looked at colors which are very bright and clashing, then i created my style sheet to style my html document.
