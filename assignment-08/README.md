Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

my overall experience learning html was a lot easier than it thought it was going to be, it was interesting learning the basic makeup of websites and seeing it come to life with my own site. the difficult part for me is just the formalities with the language and remembering to close elements.


Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

I am excited to learn how to style sites beyond the basic way we have been styling, I would not say I am anxious about anything.




Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

my work cycle for this assignment started with what I wanted my instructable to be. once i had my topic my focus shifted to remembering all that we have learned so far and putting it all together. it was easier than i thought although some of the elements i struggled with but after looking at the website i was able to figure them out. after that the assignment went pretty smooothly.
