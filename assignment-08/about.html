    <p> I chose to make my instructable about breaking in a lacrosse pocket because for the longest time when i would string a head and play with it, it would break in as you played but this would lead to alot of adjustments and inconsistency. this means alot to me because as a lacrosse player your stick is your most important equipment you have. you can learn more about stringing and the break in process from this video.
