    <p>before you begin the break in process, make sure that your lacrosse head is strung how you want it as we will be stretching the mesh and sidewall strings. once you decide you like how your head is take the baseball bat and put it between your legs while seated. take your head and begin pounding where you would like the pocket to sit. the key is to not only pound in one spot but all over as you do not want part of the mesh that is not stretched out as this could cause inconsistency.

  <h2>Step 3: Finishing up</h2>
    <img src="./images/bottom string.jpg" alt="person tying off the bottom string of a lacrosse head" title="bottom string" width="300" height="300" />
    <p>once you are happy with how the pocket is looking you need to put the bottom string in. this will effect your pockets depth and whip which is how much drag the pocket will have with the ball. once the bottom string is in you are done the break in process and are now ready to dominate the field.
