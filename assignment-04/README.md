Summarize your experience with the GIT Module. What did you learn? What was difficult, easy, or still misunderstood?

The GIT module is a very easy module to use once you learn what you are doing. At first just getting everything organized and setup was kind of difficult but after doing a couple of assignments I feel like I am starting to get the hang of it.
